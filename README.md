# EMU - GTM Blueprint Generator

**Product Name:** GTM Blueprint Generator (Working Title: "Marketing Map")  
**Version:** 2.0 (MVP)  
**Product Type:** AI-Powered SaaS Platform  
**Status:** Updated for "Continuous Copilot" Vision

## Overview

The GTM Blueprint Generator is an AI-powered strategic copilot that transforms go-to-market strategy from a static, one-time document into a **living, evolving marketing map**.

Our mission is to be the indispensable strategic partner for a new generation of builders, founders, and marketers. By leveraging an interactive "map" interface and a collaborative AI, we guide users through the continuous cycle of planning, executing, measuring, and iterating on their marketing strategy.

## Problem Statement

With the rise of AI, building a product is becoming easier than ever. However, marketing it remains just as hard. Founders and business owners still struggle with:

- **Static Plans:** Traditional GTM plans are created once and quickly become outdated, failing to adapt to market feedback.
- **Strategic Overwhelm:** It's difficult to know which part of the marketing strategy to work on at any given time.
- **Lack of Continuous Guidance:** After the initial plan is made, businesses are left on their own to execute and adapt.
- **Portfolio Chaos:** Managing distinct marketing strategies for multiple products or services is complex and disconnected.

## Solution: The Strategic Copilot

We provide a SaaS platform that acts as the central marketing brain for a business. Our solution is built on three core pillars:

1. **The Strategic Workspace:** A powerful UI combining a high-level **"Marketing Map"** for strategic overview and a focused **"Step Workspace"** for deep, guided work.
2. **The AI Copilot:** An intelligent partner that, instead of just giving answers, **proposes multiple strategic options** at each step, empowering users to make informed decisions.
3. **The Living Document System:** A central source of truth for the company's GTM strategy, viewable as a live dashboard or exportable as a professional document at any time.

This creates a continuous loop: users can see their entire strategy on the map, dive into a specific area to improve it with the AI's help, and see their map instantly update.

## Target Users

- **Startup Founder:** Needs a tool to not only create but also *manage and iterate on* the GTM strategy as they learn from the market.
- **Small Business Owner:** Needs a central hub to manage marketing plans for different services and continuously optimize their approach.
