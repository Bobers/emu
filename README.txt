Of course. This is an excellent evolution of the idea.

Here is an updated Product Requirements Document (PRD) that reflects your new vision of a continuous, AI-powered "Marketing Map" and a strategic "Copilot." It's designed to be leaner, focusing on the core modules you'll actually build.

# GTM Blueprint Generator - Product Requirements Document (v2.0)

**Product Name:** GTM Blueprint Generator (Working Title: "Marketing Map")
**Version:** 2.0 (MVP)
**Product Type:** AI-Powered SaaS Platform
**Status:** Updated for "Continuous Copilot" Vision

## 1. Executive Summary

The GTM Blueprint Generator is an AI-powered strategic copilot that transforms go-to-market strategy from a static, one-time document into a **living, evolving marketing map**.

Our mission is to be the indispensable strategic partner for a new generation of builders, founders, and marketers. By leveraging an interactive "map" interface and a collaborative AI, we guide users through the continuous cycle of planning, executing, measuring, and iterating on their marketing strategy for any and all of their products.

## 2. Problem Statement

With the rise of AI, building a product is becoming easier than ever. However, marketing it remains just as hard. Founders and business owners still struggle with:
*   **Static Plans:** Traditional GTM plans are created once and quickly become outdated, failing to adapt to market feedback.
*   **Strategic Overwhelm:** It's difficult to know which part of the marketing strategy to work on at any given time.
*   **Lack of Continuous Guidance:** After the initial plan is made, businesses are left on their own to execute and adapt.
*   **Portfolio Chaos:** Managing distinct marketing strategies for multiple products or services is complex and disconnected.

## 3. Solution Overview: The Strategic Copilot

We provide a SaaS platform that acts as the central marketing brain for a business. Our solution is built on three core pillars:

1.  **The Strategic Workspace:** A powerful UI combining a high-level **"Marketing Map"** for strategic overview and a focused **"Step Workspace"** for deep, guided work.
2.  **The AI Copilot:** An intelligent partner that, instead of just giving answers, **proposes multiple strategic options** at each step, empowering users to make informed decisions. It facilitates a continuous discovery process.
3.  **The Living Document System:** A central source of truth for the company's GTM strategy, viewable as a live dashboard or exportable as a professional document at any time.

This creates a continuous loop: users can see their entire strategy on the map, dive into a specific area to improve it with the AI's help, and see their map instantly update, always reflecting their current plan.

## 4. Target Users

The primary target users remain the same, but their goals are now long-term:
*   **Startup Founder:** Needs a tool to not only create but also *manage and iterate on* the GTM strategy as they learn from the market.
*   **Small Business Owner:** Needs a central hub to manage marketing plans for different services and continuously optimize their approach.
*   **Marketing Professional:** Needs a platform to manage GTM strategies for a portfolio of products and report on progress.

## 5. Core Features & Functionality (MVP)

The MVP will be laser-focused on the three unique modules that deliver our core value.

#### **Module 1: The Strategic Workspace (Frontend)**
*   **Marketing Map View:**
    *   The default dashboard view upon login.
    *   A visual, interactive representation of the 12 key GTM components.
    *   Sections are clearly marked with their status (e.g., To-Do, In Progress, Completed).
    *   Serves as the primary navigation hub—clicking a section opens the Step Workspace.
    *   Ability to create and switch between multiple strategy maps (e.g., for "Product A," "Service B").

*   **Step Workspace View:**
    *   A focused UI for working on a single GTM component (e.g., "Customer Identification").
    *   Presents targeted questions and input fields to the user.
    *   Features a primary "Generate Ideas" button to engage the AI Copilot.
    *   Displays AI-generated responses as **3 distinct, selectable options**.
    *   Includes a **"Regenerate" button** for new options.
    *   Allows users to select, edit, and save their chosen option, which then updates the map.

#### **Module 2: The AI Copilot Engine (Backend)**
*   **Structured AI Interaction:** Functions as a highly-structured, reliable engine, not a free-form chatbot.
*   **Context-Aware Prompts:** For each step, the engine pulls data from previously completed steps to provide the AI with critical context.
*   **Option-Based Generation:** The core logic is explicitly designed to prompt the AI to return three distinct strategic choices in a structured format (JSON).
*   **Stateful & Iterative:** The engine is built to support both filling in a blank section and re-working an existing one with new inputs.

#### **Module 3: The Living Document System**
*   **Live Web View:** A shareable, read-only web page that always displays the most current version of the strategy map.
*   **On-Demand Document Generation:** The ability to export the current state of the strategy map into a professionally formatted PDF document at any time.
*   **Fixed Document Templates:** The structure of the exported document is pre-defined, ensuring a consistent, high-quality output.

## 6. User Flow (Continuous Loop)

1.  User logs in and lands on their **Dashboard**, showing all their Strategy Maps.
2.  They select a map to work on (e.g., "GTM for New Mobile App").
3.  The **Marketing Map View** for that strategy is displayed.
4.  User sees that "Positioning Strategy" needs work and clicks on that section.
5.  The view transitions to the focused **Step Workspace** for "Positioning."
6.  User fills in a few text boxes with their initial ideas and clicks "Generate Ideas."
7.  The **AI Copilot** analyzes their input and returns 3 distinct positioning statements.
8.  The user reviews the options, selects the one they like best, makes a small edit, and clicks "Save."
9.  The user is returned to the Marketing Map, where the "Positioning" section is now marked as "Completed."
10. The user can either pick another section to work on or log out. The living strategy is saved and ready for the next session.

## 7. Monetization Strategy (SaaS Model)

We will use a recurring subscription model to align with the continuous value we provide.

| Tier | Price (Est.) | Target User | Key Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **Business** | $99/month | SMBs, Marketing Teams | • Unlimited Strategy Maps <br> • Team collaboration (Post-MVP) <br> • Custom Branding (Post-MVP) |

## 8. Technical Approach (Focus on Core Value)

We will aggressively use managed services to handle commodity tasks, allowing us to focus 100% of our development effort on our unique IP.

    *   **Hosting:** Vercel (Frontend) and Railway/Render (Backend).

## 9. Success Metrics & KPIs

Our success will be measured by user engagement and long-term value, not one-off sales.

*   **Activation:** Percentage of new users who complete at least 3 sections of their first map.
*   **Engagement:** Weekly Active Users (WAU); Number of map sections updated per user per month.
*   **Retention:** Customer Churn Rate; Lifetime Value (LTV).
*   **Revenue:** Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR); Average Revenue Per User (ARPU).
